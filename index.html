		<h2>A jQuery-like JavaScript framework.</h2>
		<sub>(only for WebKit)</sub>
		<p>BlingJS is named after the bling operator ($) to which it is bound by default.  ex.
<pre>
$("body").append('&lt;div&gt;');
</pre>

		<h3>Documentation</h3>
		<p>A "Bling" is an ordered set of items of any type.  This set defines functional operations to collect and manipulate them.
		<p>You create Blings by wrapping up other items:
<pre>
$("button") // css expressions
$("&lt;button&gt;") // or html
$([1, "foo", {a: 'b'}]) // or junk
</pre>
<p>Then you can use functional primitives like: each, map, reduce, filter, distinct, skip, take, etc. to manipulate this list.
For a full list, see the <a href="docs/index.html">BlingJS Documentation</a>
<p>During all of the functional operations, the context (the 'this' value) is set to the item being iterated.
<pre>
$("button").each(function(){
	alert(this.nodeName);
})
</pre>
<p>This would alert once for every button on the page.  Notice that the 'this' value is the raw element, not a Bling.

<p>My favorites are zip and zap. The .zip(prop) method will extract a list of the values of a certain property.  This is why .parent() is defined as simply as .zip('parentNode'), meaning, return a list of all the .parentNode properties of the items in the current set.
<p>The following are all equivalent:
<pre type="text/javascript" language="javascript">
$("button").parent().first()
$("button").zip('parentNode').first()
$("button").first().parentNode
</pre>
<p>The .zip() method is different from .attr(x), which in Bling is defined as .zip('getAttribute').call(x), and applies only to the Node attributes, not general object properties.
<p>The .zap() method is similar to .zip() except that it sets the value of the property, returning the original set of nodes.
<pre>
// hide all buttons on the page
$("button").zap("style.display","none")
</pre>

		<h3>Unit tests</h3>
		<p>If you want, you can run the <a href="test.bling.html">BlingJS unit tests</a> in your browser.
		<h3>jQuery</h3>
		<p>BlingJS is very much like jQuery, and you can do just about anything in it that you can do in jQuery.  If you know jQuery, then in general you can use BlingJS by writing what you would expect to work in jQuery, then assume everything you get is a list, and end your expressions with things like .first()
